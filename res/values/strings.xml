    <string name="health_info">The pelvic floor is the base of the group of muscles referred to as your \'core\'. 
        These muscles are located in your pelvis, and stretch like a trampoline or hammock from 
        the pubic bone (at the front) to the coccyx or tail-bone (at the back) and from side to side 
        (diagram 1).The pelvic floor muscles work with your deep abdominal (tummy) and deep back muscles 
        and diaphragm to stabilise and support your spine. They also help control the pressure inside your
         abdomen to deal with the pushing down force when you lift or strain - such as during exercise.
         Pelvic floor muscles support the bladder and bowel in men, and the bladder, bowel and uterus in 
         women. They also help maintain bladder and bowel control and play an important role in sexual 
         sensation and function. </string>
